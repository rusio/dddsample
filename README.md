DDD Sample Redux
================

This application shows a few key concepts of
Domain Driven Design implemented in Enterprise Java.

The code is a fork based on the original implementation from
[Eric Evans and Citerus] (http://dddsample.sourceforge.net),
which reflects Evan's pioneer work in his outstanding book
[Domain Driven Design - Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software]
(http://www.amazon.de/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215).

Motivation for the Fork
=======================

The goal of this fork is to follow the original code as
closely as possible, but to improve on some areas of the
original implementation, so that the codebase gets easier
to use and understand.

Current Improvements
====================

* Migrate the code to GitHub
* Enable running on Java 1.8
* Remove the inactive experimental package
* Remove unused Specification subclasses
* Collapse the hierarchy around RouteSpecification
