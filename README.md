DDD Sample Redux
================

This application shows a few key concepts of
Domain Driven Design implemented in Enterprise Java.

The code is based on the original implementation of
Eric Evans and Citerus from http://dddsample.sourceforge.net.

Motivation for the Fork
=======================

The goal of this fork is to follow the original code as
closely as possible, but to improve some areas of the
original implementation.

Current Improvements
====================

* Migrate the code to GitHub
* Enable running on Java 1.8
* Remove the inactive experimental package
* Remove unused Specification subclasses
* Collapse the hierarchy around RouteSpecification
